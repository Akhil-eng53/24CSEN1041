# A list of marks
marks = [85, 92, 78, 90, 88]

# Calculate total and number of items
total_sum = sum(marks)
number_of_subjects = len(marks)

# Calculate average
average = total_sum / number_of_subjects

print(f"Total Marks: {total_sum}")
print(f"Average Mark: {average}")

#OUTPUT
Total Marks: 433
Average Mark: 86.6
